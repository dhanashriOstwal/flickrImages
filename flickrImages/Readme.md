# About
    This application is about building a flickr web-app that fetches images from Nasa's account via the Flickr API.
    The technologies used are AngularJS(for front end) and NodeJS, deployed on IBM Bluemix. The design is responsive (used Bootstrap). Data is fetched by NodeJS from the Flickr API in JSON format and passed to AnularJS.
